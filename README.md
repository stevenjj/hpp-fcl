This project is initially a fork from https://github.com/flexible-collision-library/fcl and has evolved since then.
The main new features are:
- the use of a safety margin when detecting collision,
- the computation of a lower bound of the distance between two objects when collision checking is performed and no collision is found.
- the implementation of Python bindings for easy code prototyping.
- the fix of various bugs.

This project is now used in many robotics frameworks such as [Pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio), an open-source software which implements efficient and versatile rigid body dynamics algorithms and the [Humanoid Path Planner](https://humanoid-path-planner.github.io/hpp-doc), an open-source software for Motion and Manipulation Planning.
